        <h1> Description </h1>
        <p> How will your web site benefit a user who is interested 
        in its topic?</p>

        <h1> Personnel </h1>
        <p> names </p>
        <p> partnership time split: Estimate what fraction of the time each partner contributed.  
        Unless partners always work together, most projects are split unevenly. 
        If one partner did the bulk of the work, I expect the other partner to acknowledge that. </p>

        <h1> Citations</h1>
        <h2> people </h2>
        <p> Who helped you? What did they contribute? </p>
        <h2> programming </h2>
        <p> What ideas or code in your project originated somewhere other than the
        heads of the partners? Provide links to any sources that are publicly available.
        </p>
        <h2> data sources </h2>
        <p> If your project processes data that others collected, provide a link to it. </p>

        <h1> Desirable features, with time estimates</h1>
        <p> This section should initially list all your aims. Estimate how many hours each will take. </p>
        <p>When you accomplish an aim, move it  to the "Achievements" section. 
        Some aims will probably remain here
        after you run out of time to work on this project. </p>

        <h1 id="achievements"> Achievements </h1>
        <p> Which of your aims did you accomplish? </p>

        <h2 id="features"> Features of note </h2>
        <p> What features or results will make me happy? I would hate to miss something cool in your project. Notable achievements may include handling a difficult format in the input data, or elegantly programming a piece of the code. </p>

        <p> Do the math: in a 35-hour week I could spend 20 minutes on each of 100 projects.
        Between reading documentation, reviewing code, assigning points according to a rubric, 
        and recording comments, I can afford to spend 5-7 minutes running your project.
        Unless you tell me where to look, I am unlikely to notice the cool parts.</p>

        <p>So please tell me where to look.</p>
        <h2 id="learning"> Learning </h2>
        <p>Independent learning is an achievement that merits its own sub-section.</p>
        <p>Did you learn any new-to-you features of Python or html?  
        Did you learn to use a new tool, such as an html editor?  
        If you learned on your own, how?  
        I am particularly impressed by language elements that you learned from
        written documentation, rather than from conversation.</p>

        <h1> Next Steps, with time estimates </h1>
        <p> Populate this section as you work. </p>
        <p> Did you create a dummy version of a function
        that will be completed later? List "Implement function <dfn>f</dfn>" here. </p>
        <p> Did you find a bug whose repair can be postponed, 
        so you maintain your focus on the current task? List it here. </p>
        <p> Ace programmer Gene Lewin taught me the value of a list like this,
        which grows and shrinks during programming. Ideally, it shrinks to a null
        list and the project is considered done.  </p>

        <h1> Finished Steps, identified by worker </h1>
        <p> As you complete steps, move them from the "Next Steps" section to this section.
        For each step, identify which partner(s) did 
        the work to accomplish the step. </p>

        <h1> Bugs </h1>
        <p> What problems remain with aims you have achieved? </p>
        <p> Every program that is large enough to be interesting has bugs.
        Finding them and acknowledging them is an important, admirable
        part of programmer culture.
        </p>
        <p> If, in my brief testing, I find a bug that you did not report that's bad, 
        since it suggests you did insufficient testing, possibly none.</p>
        <p> <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sleep.3.html#BUGS">Here</a>,
        for example, is the "bugs" section from a 
        nearly-arbitrarily-selected page from the Unix documentation.
